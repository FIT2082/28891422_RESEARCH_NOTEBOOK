# Final preparation

## Weekly update

1. We produced a file containing the modelling and cross-validations of all the OAPU rooms with the 3 machine learning algorithim listed in last weeks analysis.
2. We prepared a draft for our project presentation
3. We exluded the variable end temp of the heating period after our meeting as it is redundant and is not relevant in our case.

## Next weeks plans

We plan on completing a main chunck of our report and try to attract the interst of fellow students on the potential of this project to revolutionise AC operational methods to make it relaxing for students and energy efficient for organisation that build an AC with these models built in them.


## Potential of this project 

The modelling we produced were quite accurate so if for example, you take a very accurate model for a room and create an interface between the AC itself and the model. So when the room is not occupied the AC can turn off and since it keeps track of all the paramters we investigated in our research, it can predict what the rate would be if AC/OAPU were to turn giving us an estimated time of how long the AC/OAPU will take to heat up the room when room is occupied. This is really good as it allows us to let the OAPU turn off and and come back to setpoint with estimated time rather then the current system which keeps the AC/OAPU in constant operation to maintain the room tempreture even when no one is occupied.
